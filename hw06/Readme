Task Tracker Web App:

Database Design:
1. Two tables i.e, users and works are created in the database.
2. users table has following fields:
   name   : <string>, null: false 
   email  : <string>, null: false
   
   So when a user registers, above fields manadatory. Once the user submits the       	 information, its stored in the database and later used for retrieval

3. works table has following fileds:
   user_id    : <number> (foreign key referencing user table), null: false, on_delete: delete_all
   assigned_by: <string>, null: false
   task_title : <string>
   task_body  : <string>
   done?      : <boolean>
   done_time  : <time> 
   
   The above database design is made so that the app has the following main features:
   a) User cannot login without entering email address and name
   b) user_id in works table is referencing the users table and if a user is deleted, all tasks corresponding to that user is deleted.
   c) time is taken as input from the user in terms of hours and minutes. But, minutes is taken only in the increments of 15. This is handles in the controller file.
   d) Once the task is created, summary of the task can be seen again. It can be edited and also can be deleted.

4. Once the user logs in, the current user is stored in the session.
