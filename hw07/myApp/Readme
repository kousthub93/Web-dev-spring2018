Task Tracker Web App:

Database Design:
1. Two tables i.e, users and works are created in the database.
2. users table has following fields:
   name   : <string>, null: false 
   email  : <string>, null: false
   manager_id : <string>
   So when a user registers, above fields manadatory except manager_id. Once the user submits the information, its stored in the database and later used for retrieval
   The user can be a manager who can assign tasks to only users who are subordinates to him and get assigned tasks by his/her managers.
3. works table has following fileds:
   user_id    : <number> (foreign key referencing user table), null: false, on_delete: delete_all
   assigned_by: <string>, null: false
   task_title : <string>
   task_body  : <string>
   done?      : <boolean>
   done_time  : <time> 
   
   The above database design is made so that the app has the following main features:
   a) User cannot login without entering email address and name
   b) user_id in works table is referencing the users table and if a user is deleted, all tasks corresponding to that user is deleted.
   c) time is taken as input from the user in terms of hours and minutes. But, minutes is taken only in the increments of 15. This is handles in the controller file.
   d) Once the task is created, summary of the task can be seen again. It can be edited and also can be deleted. 
      In the same page, the time blocks are displayed, where the user can use the "Start" button to indicate the start time of the task.
      In the same way user can click on the update end time button to end the certain time block.
      User can also delete the record of time as well.
      This interface enables the user/manager to keep track of the time spent intervals on each task.

4. Once the user logs in, the current user is stored in the session.

5. The tasks assigned by the user are only visible on the tasks page.
